i met a guy in the summer and i left him in the spring he argued with me about everything
he had an ego and a temper and a wandering eye he said he’s six foot two and i’m like, dude, nice try
but he was so much fun and he had such weird friends
and he would take us out to parties and the night would never end another song, another club, another bar, another dance
and when he said something wrong he’d just fly me to france
so i miss him some nights when i’m feeling depressed till i remember every time he made a pass on my friend do i love him, do i hate him
i guess it’s up and down
if i had to choose, i would say right now
i wanna get him back
i wanna make him really jealous wanna make him feel bad oh i wanna get him back
cuz then again i really miss him and it makes me real sad oh i want sweet revenge
and i want him again
i want to get him back back back
 
so i write him all these letters and I throw them in the trash cuz i miss the way he kisses and the way he made me laugh yeah i pour my little heart out but as i’m hitting send
i picture all the faces of my disappointed friends because everyone knew all of the shit that he’d do
he said i was the only girl but that just wasn’t the truth and when i told him how he hurt me
he’d tell me i was tripping but i am my father’s daughter so maybe i could fix him!
i wanna get him back
i wanna make him really jealous wanna make him feel bad oh i wanna get him back
cuz then again i really miss him and it makes me real sad oh i want sweet revenge
and i want him again
i want to get him back and then!
i want to get him back back back
i wanna key his car
i wanna make him lunch

i wanna break his heart
then be the one to stitch it up wanna kiss his face
with an uppercut
i wanna meet his mom
just to tell her her son sucks
i wanna key his car
i wanna make him lunch i wanna break his heart stitch it right back up
i wanna kiss his face with an uppercut
i wanna meet his mom
and tell her her son sucks yeah
i wanna get him back
I wanna make him really jealous wanna make him feel bad oh i wanna get him back
cuz then again i really miss him and it makes me real sad oh i want sweet revenge and
i want him again
i want to get him back and then!
i want to get him back back back
