drivin’ on the 
right side road
he says i’m pretty 
wearing his clothes
and he’s got hands that 
make hell seem cold
feet on the dashboard 
he’s like a poem i wish i wrote 
i wish i wrote

when he laughs at all my jokes
and he says i’m so american
oh god, it’s just not fair of him 
to make me feel this much 

i’ll go anywhere he goes
and he says i’m so american
oh god, i’m gonna marry him 
if he keeps this shit up 
i might just be in 
la la la la la la la la la la love 

god, i’m so boring 
and i’m so rude
can’t have a conversation 
if it’s not all about you 
the way you dress and 
the books you read 
i really love my bed 
but man it’s hard to sleep 
when he’s with me 
when he’s with me 

and he laughs at all my jokes 
and he says i’m so american 
oh god, it’s just not fair of him 
to make me feel this much 

i’ll go anywhere he goes
and he says i’m so american 
oh god, i’m gonna marry him 
if he keeps this shit up 
i might just be in 
la la la la la la la la la la love 

i apologize if it’s 
a little too much 
just a little too soon 
but if the conversation 
ever were to come up 
i don’t wanna assume this stuff
but ain’t it love
i think i’m in love 

and he laughs at all my jokes 
and he says i’m so american
oh god, it’s just not fair of him 
to make me feel this much 
i’ll go anywhere he goes 
and he says i’m so american
oh god, i’m gonna marry him 
if he keeps this shit up 
i might just be in 
la la la la la la la la la la love
