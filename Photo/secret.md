# obsessed

La, da-da-da, da-da-la, la-da-da-da-da
La, da-da-da, da-da-da

[Verse 1]
If I told you how much I think about her
You'd think I was in love
And if you knew how much I looked at her pictures
You would think we're best friends

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I know her star sign, I know her blood type
I've seen every movie she's been in, and, oh, God, she's beautiful
And I know you loved her, and I know I'm butthurt
But I can't help it, no, I can't help it

[Chorus]
I'm so obsessed with your ex (Uh-huh)
I know she's been asleep on my side of your bed, and I can feel it
I'm starin' at her like I wanna get hurt
And I remember every detail you have evеr told me, so be careful, baby

[Post-Chorus]
I'm so obsеssed with your ex (Ah)
Yeah, I'm so obsessed with your ex (Ah)
La, da-da-da, da-da-da

[Verse 2]
She's got those lips, she's got those hips
The life of every fuckin' party
She's talented, she's good with kids
She even speaks kindly about me, ha-ha

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know you love me, and I know it's crazy
But, every time you call my name, I think you mistake me for her
You both have moved on, you don't even talk
But I can't help it, I got issues, I can't help it, baby

[Chorus]
I'm so obsessed with your ex
I know she's been asleep on my side in your bed, and I can feel it
I'm starin' at her like I wanna get hurt
And I remember every detail you have ever told me, so be careful, baby

[Post-Chorus]
I'm so obsessed with your ex (Ah)
Yeah, I'm so obsessed with your ex (Ah)

[Bridge]
Is she friends with your friends? Is she good in bed?
Do you think about her? No, I'm fine, it doesn't matter, tell me
Is she easy-going? Never controlling?
Well-traveled? Well-read? Oh, God, she makes me so upset
[Chorus]
I'm so obsessed with your ex (Ah)
She's been asleep on my side of your bed (Ah), woah
I'm so obsessed with your ex (God, she makes me so upset)
I'm so obsessed with your, with your ex

# scared of my guitar

Perfect, easy, so good to me
So why's there a pit in my gut in the shape of you?
Distract myself, say it's somethin' else
Maybe I'm just overwhelmed, maybe I'm confused

[Pre-Chorus]
Barely sleep when you sleep next to me
But I keep thinkin' I'll find a cure
I say that I'm fine, I tell you all the time
I've never felt so happy and sure

[Chorus]
But I'm so scared of my guitar
'Cause it cuts right through to the heart
Yeah, it knows me too well so I got no excuse
I can't lie to it the same way that I lie to you
I'm so scared of my guitar
If I play it, then I'll think too hard
Once you let the thought in, then it's already done
So I'll lay in your arms and pretend that it's love

[Verse 2]
If I was brave and noble like you
I'd have the nerve to just stop stringin' you along
But I'm not half as decent as you
I'd rather be tied to someone, even if they're wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
I make excuses, my friends know the truth is
I'm not as alright as I claim
I say that I'm fine, I tell them all the time
As they watch all the light fade away

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm so scared of my guitar
'Cause it cuts right through to the heart
Yeah, it knows me too well so I got no excuse
I can't lie to it the same way that I lie to you
I'm so scared of my guitar
If I play it, then I'll think too hard
Once you let the thought in, then it's already done
So I'll lay in your arms and pretend that it's love
Yeah, I'll lay in your arms and pretend that it's

[Bridge]
Love
I pretend that it's love
I pretend that it's love
I pretend that it's love, love

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause what if I never find anything better?
The doubt always creeps through my mind
So we'll stay together 'cause how could I ever
Trade somethin' that's good for what's right?
[Chorus]
Oh, I'm so scared of my guitar
It cuts right through to my heart
It knows me too well, I got no excuse
I can't lie to it the same way that I lie to you
I'm so scared of my guitar
When I play it is when I think too hard
I let the thought in, it's already done
But I'll lay in your arms and pretend that it's love
Yeah, I'll lay in your arms and pretend it's enough

# stranger

[Verse 1]
I woke up this mornin' and I sat up straight in bed
I had the strangest feeling of this weight off of my chest
I hadn't felt that hopeful since the day that you left
And it felt nice, so nice
And everybody told me it would happen in time
The fire would burn out and all the storm clouds'd subside
And I always believed that it was some comforting lie
But it feels nice, so nice

[Chorus]
'Cause I was half myself without you and now I feel so complete
And I can't even remember what made me lose all that sleep
I criеd a million rivers for you, but that's over now
You're just a strangеr I know everything about, ooh, ooh
You're just a stranger I know everything about

[Verse 2]
Made a pot of coffee and I poured myself a cup
I thought of all the things I did to try and win your love
How did that happen? I can't imagine ever doing all that stuff for just some guy
Like, you're just some guy
Oh, but I hope that you're happy, babe, you know I really do
And God knows that I am the girl I am because of you
You know I'll always think of you, I'll love ya 'til the end of time
You are the best thing that I'll ever keep so far out of my life

Yeah, I was half myself without you and now I feel so complete
I can't even remember what made me lose all that sleep
I cried a million rivers for you, but that's over now
You're just a stranger I know everything about, ooh, ooh
You're just a stranger I know everything about

[Bridge]
There's nothin' left for me to know
I had to stay, you had to go
And it was mean, but it doesn't matter anymore, though
There's nothin' left for me to sing
I screamed, I cried, I did the whole thing
And I loved you mad, but it doesn't matter anymore, no

[Chorus]
I was half myself without you, now I feel so complete
And if I'm not enough for you, you're not enough for me
I fought a million battles, but you can't get to me now
You're just a stranger I know everything about, ooh, ooh
You're just a stranger I know everything about
You're just a stranger I know everything about
